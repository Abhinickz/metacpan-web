# Important, please read:

MetaCPAN's core developers need to focus on fixing bugs and improving the
existing core system.

For this reason, if you have a feature which you would like to see added (there
are loads we would love to have), please only open an issue _IF_ you are
prepared to do the work to implement it.  To be clear, we'd love to have a
bunch of really cool, new, features, but it's more important for us to focus on
keeping MetaCPAN humming along.

If you're not motivated or otherwise able to send a pull request for your cool,
new feature, please add it to our wishlist:
https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/wiki/Wishlist and someone may get to it
one day.  Maybe that person will be you!

For more details on issues and contributing please see CONTRIBUTING.md (linked
above).
