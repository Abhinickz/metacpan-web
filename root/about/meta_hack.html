      <h1>meta::hack</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        In November 2016, several MetaCPAN developers came together in Chicago
        for an invite-only intensive workshop, dubbed meta::hack, to upgrade the MetaCPAN API
        and do other critical work on the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event was a success!  Neil Bowers and several attendees have
        written blog posts about the event, giving an idea of what it was
        like:
      </p>

      </ul>
      <p>
        This event and the work done there was made possible by the generous
        donations of sponsors.
